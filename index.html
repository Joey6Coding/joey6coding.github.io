                <p class="main">Hello, my name is Joseph Bettis and I'm a student at Fox Valley Technical College. I am currently in IT - Software Development, and hoping to turn this into a career someday. I was born in Landstuhl, Germany, but I've lived in Appleton, Wisconsin for the last fifteen years. I'm a huge Wisconsin sports fan and I love to watch Football and Basketball specifically. I also like motorsports, especially Formula 1 and Nascar. I also play guitar, love music, and enjoy collecting vinyls. Lastly, since I don't like taking pictures of myself <a href="pic.html">Click Here</a> for a rushed picture I took.</p>
